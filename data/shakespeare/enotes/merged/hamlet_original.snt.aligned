Who's there?
Nay, answer me.
Stand and unfold yourself.
Long live the King!
Bernardo?
He.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
tis now struck twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.
For this relief much thanks.
tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.
Have you had quiet guard?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
I think I hear them.
Stand, ho!
Who is there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
Bernardo hath my place.
Give you good night.
Say, What, is Horatio there?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, good Marcellus.
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one— Peace!
Look where it comes again!
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Looks it not like the King?
Mark it, Horatio.
Most like.
It harrows me with fear and wonder.
It would be spoke to.
Question it, Horatio.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march?
By heaven I charge thee speak!
It is offended.
See, it stalks away!
Stay!
speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!
tis gone, and will not answer.
How now, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
Is it not like the King?
As thou art to thyself.
tis strange.
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Who is't that can inform me?
That can I; At least the whisper goes so.
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of feared events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.
Lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.
Stay illusion!
stay, and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus!
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do, if it will not stand.
tis here!
tis here!
tis gone!
We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons.
I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day, and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Let's do't, I pray: and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. 
Nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along.
For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother.
So much for him.
Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras— Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose—to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
In that and all things will we show our duty.
We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit.
What is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so, my lord: I am too much i' the sun.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Ay, madam, it is common.
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?
Seems, madam?
Nay, it is.
Fie!
tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died today, This must be so.
We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you.
For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee, stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark.
Come away.
O God!
God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't!
ah, fie!
tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.
That it should come to this!
But two months dead!
Heaven and earth!
Must I remember?
Frailty, thy name is woman— A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears—why she, even she— O God!
a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer—married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules.
Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married.
O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not, nor it cannot come to, good.
But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well.
Horatio—or I do forget myself.
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?— Marcellus?
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.
I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio.
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father—methinks I see my father.
O, where, my lord?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
He was a man, take him for all in all; I shall not look upon his like again.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, the King your father.
The King my father?
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
For God's love let me hear!
But where was this?
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Did you not speak to it?
My lord, I did; But answer made it none.
tis very strange.
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Hold you the watch tonight?
We do, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?
O, yes, my lord!
He wore his beaver up.
What, look'd he frowningly?
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Pale, or red?
Nay, very pale.
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.
Very like, very like.
Stay'd it long?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Longer, longer.
Not when I saw't.
His beard was grizzled, no?
It was as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.
I warrant it will.
If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
I will requite your loves.
So, fare you well.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.
Our duty to your honour.
Your loves, as mine to you.
Farewell.
My father's spirit in arms!
Would the night were come.
Till then sit still, my soul.
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. 
My necessaries are embark'd.
Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.
Do you doubt that?
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favours, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Think it no more.
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal.
He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head.
Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes.
The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not!
I stay too long.
But here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for.
There, my blessing with thee.
And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell.
My blessing season this in thee!
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Farewell.
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Marry, well bethought!
What is between you?
Give me up the truth.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
Affection?
Pooh!
You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Marry, I'll teach you.
Think yourself a baby, That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you'll tender me a fool.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.
These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire.
For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you.
In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds, The better to beguile.
Look to't, I charge you.
Come your ways.
I shall obey, my lord. 
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.
No, it is struck.
Indeed?
I heard it not.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What doth this mean, my lord?
The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels, And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?
Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth—wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin— By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men— Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star— Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo— Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault.
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.
O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements, why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.
What may this mean That thou, dead corse, again, in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this?
Wherefore?
What should we do?
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it!
No, by no means.
It will not speak; then will I follow it.
Do not, my lord!
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again.
I'll follow it.
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness?
Think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands!
You shall not go.
My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I say, away!
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Have after.
To what issue will this come?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow him. 
Whither wilt thou lead me?
Speak!
I'll go no further.
Mark me.
I will.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
What!
I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away.
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.
List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love— O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder?
Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.
Now, Hamlet, hear.
tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard, A serpent stung me.
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle!
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!
But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage.
But soft!
O, horrible!
O, horrible!
most horrible!
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught.
Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once.
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu!
Remember me.
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
What else?
And shall I couple hell?
O, fie!
Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.
Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter.
Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are.
Now to my word: It is ‘Adieu, adieu!
Remember me.’ I have sworn't.
My lord, my lord!
So be it!
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.
How is't, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.
No; you will reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
Nor I, my lord.
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I am sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, faith, heartily.
There's no offence, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too.
Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desire to know what is between us O'ermaster't as you may.
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
What is't, my lord?
We will.
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
My lord, we will not.
Nay, but swear't.
In faith, My lord, not I.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Swear.
Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on!
Propose the oath, my lord.
Swear.
Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard: Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Well said, old mole!
Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner!
Once more remove, good friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Swear.
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint.
O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together. 
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behaviour.
My lord, I did intend it.
Marry, well said, very well said.
Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends, And in part him.’ Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Ay, very well, my lord.
And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well.
As gaming, my lord?
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing.
You may go so far.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency.
That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?
Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Marry, sir, here's my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And then, sir, does he this—he does—what was I about to say?
So, by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son.
You have me, have you not?
My lord, I have.
Good my lord!
Observe his inclination in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him play his music.
Well, my lord.
Farewell!
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
With what, i' the name of God?
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced, No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled, Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know, But truly I do fear it.
What said he?
He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it.
Come, go with me.
I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
No, my good lord; but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.
I fear'd he did but trifle And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
Come, go we to the King.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. 
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.
What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.
I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time; so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That open'd lies within our remedy.
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres.
If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance.
Both your Majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Ay, amen!
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord?
Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King.
And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper.
I doubt it is no other but the main, His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome, my good friends.
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time we'll read, Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home!
This business is well ended.
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this.
Now gather, and surmise.
Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans.
But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it.
Adieu.
Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet.
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.
But how hath she Receiv'd his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honourable.
I would fain prove so.
Do you think 'tis this?
It may be, very like.
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said ‘'tis so,’ When it proved otherwise?
Not that I know.
Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.
How may we try it further?
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter.
If he love her not, And he not from his reason fall'n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.
We will try it.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
O, give me leave.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well, God-a-mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Not I, my lord.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord?
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a daughter?
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.
Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to't.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.
He is far gone.
And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love, very near this.
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am if, if like a crab, you could go backward.
Into my grave?
Indeed, that is out of the air.
Aside.
How sometimes his replies are!
a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Fare you well, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
God save you, sir!
My honoured lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do ye both?
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
Faith, her privates we.
In the secret parts of Fortune?
What news?
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Prison, my lord?
Denmark's a prison.
Then is the world one.
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
To me it is a prison.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to the court?
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.
We'll wait upon you.
No such matter!
I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended.
But in the beaten way of friend- ship, what make you at Elsinore?
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you; And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were you not sent for?
Is it your own inclin- ing?
Is it a free visitation?
Come, deal justly with me.
What should we say, my lord?
Why, anything, but to the purpose.
You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour.
I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.
To what end, my lord?
That you must teach me.
But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.
What say you?
My lord, we were sent for.
I have of late—but wherefore I know not— lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man!
how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty!
in form and moving how express and admirable!
in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god!
And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?
Man delights not me—no, nor woman nei- ther, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said man delights not me?
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you.
We coted them on the way, and hither are they com- ing to offer you service.
What players are they?
Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.
How chances it they travel?
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
Are they so followed?
No, indeed, are they not.
How comes it?
Do they grow rusty?
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't.
These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
What, are they children?
Who maintains 'em?
How are they escoted?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controver- sy.
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
Is't possible?
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Do the boys carry it away?
Ay, that they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too.
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Your hands, come!
Then appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.
Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players—which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards—should more appear like entertainment than yours.
You are welcome.
But my uncle-father and aunt- mother are deceived.
In what, my dear lord?
I am but mad north-north-west.
When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players.
Mark it.
You say right, sir; o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
Buzz, buzz!
Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.
For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
What treasure had he, my lord?
Why, ‘One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well.’ Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
Nay, that follows not.
What follows then, my lord?
Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was.— The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look where my abridgment comes.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.
I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.
What, my young lady and mistress?
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine.
Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.
Masters, you are all welcome.
We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see.
We'll have a speech straight.
Come, give us a taste of your quality.
Come, a passionate speech.
What speech, my good lord?
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much mod- esty as cunning.
I remember one said there were no sal- lets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no mat- ter in the phrase that might indict the author of affecta- tion; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine.
Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick'd With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons.
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks.
His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command.
Unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls.
Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.
For lo!
his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick.
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing.
But as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death—anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour, forged for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune!
All you gods, In general synod take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends!
This is too long.
It shall to the barber's, with your beard.
Prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.
Say on; come to Hecuba.
mobled queen’ is good.
Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o'erteemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up— Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced.
But if the gods themselves did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made Unless things mortal move them not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And passion in the gods.
Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.
Prithee no more!
tis well.
I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd?
Do you hear?
Let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.
After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
God's bodykins, man, much better!
Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends.
We'll hear a play to-morrow.
Dost thou hear me, old friend?
We'll ha't tomorrow night.
Ay, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night.
You are wel- come to Elsinore.
Good my lord!
Ay, so, God be wi' ye!
Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit?
And all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?
What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have?
He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain?
breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose?
gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs?
Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I!
This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion!
Fie upon't!
Foh!
About, my brain!
Hum, I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle.
I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick.
If he but blench, I know my course.
I'll have grounds More relative than this.
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. 
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from what cause he will by no means speak.
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.
Did you assay him To any pastime?
Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way.
Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it.
They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
tis most true; And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights.
We shall, my lord.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia.
Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him, as he is behaved, If't be the affliction of his love or no, That thus he suffers for.
So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, walk you here.
Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.
Read on this book, That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness.
We are oft to blame in this— 'tis too much proved—that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The Devil himself.
O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burden!
I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of disprized love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.
Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!
Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.
Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
Are you honest?
My lord?
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.
I did love you once.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it.
I loved you not.
I was the more deceived.
Get thee to a nunnery!
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.
What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven?
We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
At home, my lord.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house.
Farewell.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.
Get thee to a nunnery.
Go, farewell.
Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
O heavenly powers, restore him!
You jig, you amble, and you lisp; and nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.
I say, we will have no more marriages.
Those that are married already—all but one—shall live; the rest shall keep as they are.
To a nunnery, go.
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy.
O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Love?
His affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness.
There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different, With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself.
What think you on't?
It shall do well.
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.
How now, Ophelia?
My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play, Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief.
Let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference.
If she find him not, To England send him; or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. 
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.
Pray you avoid it.
I warrant your honour.
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.
Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.
Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.
O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
O, reform it altogether!
That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go make you ready.
How now, my lord?
Will the King hear this piece of work?
And the Queen too, and that presently.
We will, my lord.
What, ho, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.
Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice, And could of men distinguish her election, Sh'hath seal'd thee for herself.
For thou hast been As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing; A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please.
Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.
Something too much of this.
There is a play tonight before the King.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance, Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle.
If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy.
Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.
Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
They are coming to the play.
I must be idle.
Get you a place.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish.
I eat the air, promise-cramm'd.
You cannot feed capons so.
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you play'd once i' th' university, you say?
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me.
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.
Be the players ready.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
O, ho!
do you mark that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Ay, my lord.
Do you think I meant country matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, I?
Ay, my lord.
O God, your only jig-maker!
What should a man do but be merry?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two hours.
Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.
O heavens!
die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ay, or any show that you'll show him.
Be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
You are naught, you are naught!
I'll mark the play.
For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently.
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
tis brief, my lord.
As woman's love.
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
That I distrust you.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who killed the first.
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed.
I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
If she should break it now!
tis deeply sworn.
Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain!
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?
Is there no offence in't?
No, no!
They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world.
What do you call the play?
The Mousetrap.
Marry, how?
Tropically.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
tis a knavish piece of work; but what o' that?
Your Majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not.
Let the galled jade winch; our withers are unwrung.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Still better, and worse.
So you must take your husbands.
Begin, murderer.
Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin!
He poisons him i' the garden for his estate.
His name's Gonzago.
The King rises.
What, frighted with false fire?
How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.
Give me some light.
Away!
Lights, lights, lights!
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers—if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me—with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
Half a share.
You might have rhymed.
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound!
Didst perceive?
Very well, my lord.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
I did very well note him.
Ah, ha!
Come, some music!
Come, some music!
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Sir, a whole history.
The King, sir— Ay, sir, what of him?
Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord; rather with choler.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor; for, me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
I am tame, sir.
Pronounce.
The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you.
You are welcome.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother.
Therefore no more, but to the matter!
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Have you any further trade with us?
My lord, you once did love me.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.
Sir, I lack advancement.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark?
Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'—the proverb is something musty.
O, the recorders!
Let me see one.
To withdraw with you— why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?
My lord, I cannot.
I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
It is as easy as lying.
Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak.
Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.
God bless you, sir!
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then will I come to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
By and by' is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on.
Soft!
now to my mother!
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his brows.
We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty.
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many.
The cess of majesty Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw What's near it with it.
It is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.
Never alone Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.
We will haste us.
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process.
I'll warrant she'll tax him home; And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage.
Fare you well, my liege.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.
Thanks, dear my lord.
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow?
Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being down?
Then I'll look up; My fault is past.
But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn?
Forgive me my foul murder?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder— My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
What then?
What rests?
Try what repentance can.
What can it not?
O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged!
Help, angels!
Make assay.
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
All may be well.
That would be scann'd.
A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
He took my father grossly, full of bread, With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
No.
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage; Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At game, a-swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes.
My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. 
He will come straight.
Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him.
I'll silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
Withdraw; I hear him coming.
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Why, how now, Hamlet?
What's the matter now?
Have you forgot me?
No, by the rood, not so!
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife, And—would it were not so—you are my mother.
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
What, ho!
Help, help, help!
Draws.
O, I am slain!
O me, what hast thou done?
Nay, I know not.
Is it the King?
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
A bloody deed.
Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
As kill a king?
Ay, lady, it was my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better.
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace!
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?
Heaven's face doth glow; Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act.
Ay me, what act, That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
Look here upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear Blasting his wholesome brother.
Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this Moor?
Ha!
have you eyes?
What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope.
O shame!
where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire.
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn, And reason panders will.
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.
Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty!
No more!
A king of shreds and patches!
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards!
What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he's mad!
Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command?
O, say!
Do not forget.
This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
How is it with you, lady?
Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy, And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements, Start up and stand on end.
O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience!
Whereon do you look?
On him, on him!
Look you how pale he glares!
Then what I have to do Will want true colour—tears perchance for blood.
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nor did you nothing hear?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look you there!
Look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.
Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music.
It is not madness That I have utt'red.
Bring me to the test, And I the matter will reword; which madness Would gambol from.
Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen.
Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker.
Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half, Good night—but go not to my uncle's bed.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on.
Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence; the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And [either master] the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency.
For this same lord, I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so, To punish me with this, and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him.
So again, good night.
One word more, good lady.
What shall I do?
Twere good you let him know; For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib Such dear concernings hide?
Who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep And break your own neck down.
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.
I must to England; you know that?
Alack, I had forgot!
Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar; and ' shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon.
O, 'tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet.
Mother, good night.
Indeed, this counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother. 
There's matter in these sighs.
Where is your son?
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How does Hamlet?
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier.
In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!
And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man.
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all, To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt This mad young man.
But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit, But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life.
Where is he gone?
He weeps for what is done.
O Gertrude, come away!
Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I pray you haste in this.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what's untimely done.
So haply slander Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name And hit the woundless air.—O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay. 
Safely stow'd.
Hamlet!
Lord Hamlet!
What noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
Do not believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own.
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, his authorities.
But such officers do the King best service in the end.
He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouth'd, to be last swallowed.
When he needs what you have glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
I understand you not, my lord.
I am glad of it.
A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
The King is a thing— A thing, my lord?
Of nothing.
Bring me to him.
Hide fox, and all after. 
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence.
To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause.
Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all.
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, We cannot get from him.
But where is he?
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper.
At supper?
Where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him.
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.
Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table.
That's the end.
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
What dost thou mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send thither to see.
If your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself.
But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stair, into the lobby.
Go seek him there.
He will stay till you come.
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety— Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done—must send thee hence With fiery quickness.
For England?
Ay, Hamlet.
Good.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
I see a cherub that sees them.
But come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
My mother!
Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother.
Come, for England!
Delay it not; I'll have him hence tonight.
Away!
for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair.
Pray you, make haste.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught— As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us—thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.
Till I know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. 
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom.
You know the rendezvous.
If that his Majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so.
I will do't, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose powers are these?
They are of Norway, sir.
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw.
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies.
I humbly thank you, sir.
God be wi' you, sir.
Will't please you go, my lord?
I'll be with you straight.
Go a little before.
How all occasions do inform against me And spur my dull revenge!
What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed?
A beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused.
Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event— A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward—I do not know Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,' Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do't.
Examples gross as earth exhort me.
Witness this army, of such mass and charge, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd, Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell.
Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake.
How stand I then, That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep, while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain?
O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! 
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Let her come in.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
How should I your true love know From another one?
By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon.
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Say you?
Nay, pray you, mark.
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone.
Nay, but Ophelia— Pray you, mark.
White his shroud as the mountain snow— Alas, look here, my lord!
Larded all with sweet flowers; Which bewept to the grave did not go With true-love showers.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'eild you!
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
God be at your table!
Conceit upon her father.
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es And dupp'd the chamber door, Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more.
Pretty Ophelia!
Indeed, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't if they come to't By Cock, they are to blame.
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient.
But I can- not choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
My brother shall know of it.
And so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach!
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death.
O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death.
Alack, what noise is this?
Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?
Save yourself, my lord.
The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O'erbears your offices.
The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known— The ratifiers and props of every word— They cry 'Choose we!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
The doors are broke.
Where is this King?
Sirs, stand you all without.
No, let's come in!
I pray you give me leave.
We will, we will!
I thank you.
Keep the door.
O thou vile king, Give me my father!
Calmly, good Laertes.
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard; Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brows Of my true mother.
What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
There's such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will.
Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed.
Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
Where is my father?
Dead.
But not by him!
How came he dead?
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation.
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world!
And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.
Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms And, like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.
Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye.
Let her come in.
How now?
What noise is that?
O heat, dry up my brains!
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens!
is't possible a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.
They bore him barefac'd on the bier (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony) And on his grave rain'd many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.
It is the false stew- ard, that stole his master's daughter.
This nothing's more than matter.
There's fennel for you, and columbines.
There's rue for you, and here's some for me.
There's a daisy.
I would give you some violets, but they with- er'd all when my father died.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead; Go to thy deathbed; He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan.
God 'a'mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.
God be wi' you.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.
Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content.
His means of death, his obscure burial— No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation, Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call't in question.
So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you go with me. 
What are they that would speak with me?
Seafaring men, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them come in.
I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless thee too.
He shall, sir, an't please him.
Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd this, give these fellows some means to the King.
They have letters for him.
Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase.
Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them.
On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner.
Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.
I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.
These good fellows will bring thee where I am.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England.
Of them I have much to tell thee.
Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.
Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And do't the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. 
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
It well appears.
But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd up.
O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, But yet to me they are strong.
The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself— My virtue or my plague, be it either which— She's so conjunctive to my life and soul That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her.
The other motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the general gender bear him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim'd them.
And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections.
But my revenge will come.
Break not your sleeps for that.
You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger, And think it pastime.
You shortly shall hear more.
What news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
From Hamlet?
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
What should this mean?
Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Know you the hand?
tis Hamlet's character.
I'm lost in it, my lord.
But let him come.
how otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?
Ay my lord, So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
To thine own peace.
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine.
Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one; and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.
What part is that, my lord?
A very ribbon in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness.
Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy— I have seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback; but this gallant Had witchcraft in't.
He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast.
So far he topp'd my thought That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
Upon my life, Lamord.
The very same.
I know him well.
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.
Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his own too much.
That we would do, We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing.
But to the quick o' the ulcer!
Hamlet comes back.
What would you undertake To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words?
To cut his throat i' the church.
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads.
He, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, Requite him for your father.
I will do't!
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death This is but scratch'd withal.
I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.
Therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold If this did blast in proof.
Soft!
let me see.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings— I ha't!
When in your motion you are hot and dry— As make your bouts more violent to that end— And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there.
How now, sweet Queen?
One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow.
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
Drown'd!
O, where?
Alas, then she is drown'd?
Drown'd, drown'd.
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will.
When these are gone, The woman will be out.
Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze But that this folly drowns it.
Let's follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage.
Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own defence?
Why, 'tis found so.
It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else.
For se offendendo; it cannot be else.
Here lies the water—good.
Here stands the man—good.
But is this law?
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Will you ha' the truth on't?
If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
Why, there thou say'st!
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian.
Come, my spade!
There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They hold up Adam's profession.
Was he a gentleman?
A was the first that ever bore arms.
Why, he had none.
What, art a heathen?
How dost thou under- stand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he dig without arms?
I'll put another question to thee.
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
I like thy wit well, in good faith.
To't again, come!
Who builds stronger than a mason, a ship- wright, or a carpenter?
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Marry, now I can tell!
To't.
Mass, I cannot tell.
Go, get thee in Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.
In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet; To contract—O—the time for—a—my behove, O, methought there—a—was nothing—a meet.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
tis e'en so.
The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.
How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if 'were Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!
This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?
It might, my lord.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, sweet lord?
This might be my Lord Such-a- one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?
Ay, my lord.
Why, e'en so!
and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd about the mazard with a sexton's spade.
Here's fine revolution, and we had the trick to see't.
Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggets with 'em?
Mine ache to think on't.
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet; O, a Pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
There's another.
Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?
Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?
Hum!
This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries.
Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt?
Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures?
The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.
I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave's this, sir- rah?
Mine, sir.
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it' 'tis thine.
tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman then?
For none, neither.
Who is to be buried in't?
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolute the knave is!
We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, this three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.
How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that?
Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
A shall recover his wits there; or, if a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
Why?
Twill not he seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.
How 'strangely'?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in—he will last you some eight year or nine year.
A tanner will last you nine year.
Why he more than another?
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that a will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull, now.
This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty years.
Whose was it?
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was.
Whose do you think it was?
Nay, I know not.
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!
A poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the King's jester.
This?
E'en that.
Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
My gorge rises at it.
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.
Where be your gibes now?
your gambols?
your songs?
your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar?
Not one now to mock your own grinning?
Quite chop-fallen?
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
What's that, my lord?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
Pah!
E'en so, my lord.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
But soft!
Who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites?
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life.
Twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
What ceremony else?
That is Laertes, a very noble youth.
Mark.
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty.
Must there no more be done?
Lay her i' the earth; And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.
What, the fair Ophelia?
Sweets to the sweet!
Farewell.
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave.
O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!
Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of this flat a mountain you have made To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear.
Hold off thy hand!
Pluck them asunder.
Gentlemen!
Good my lord, be quiet.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?
O, he is mad, Laertes.
For love of God, forbear him!
Swounds, show me what thou'lt do.
I'll do't.
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart!
Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.
I loved you ever.
But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
We'll put the matter to the present push.— Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument.
So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
Remember it, my lord!
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.
such bugs and goblins in my life, That on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.
Is't possible?
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
I beseech you.
Being thus benetted round with villainies— Or I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play—I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service.
Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?
Ay, good my lord.
An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such like as's of great charge, That on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd.
How was this seal'd?
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon— He that hath kill'd my king, and whored my mother; Popp'd in between the election and my hopes; Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage—is't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm?
And is't not to be damn'd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
It will be short; the interim is mine, And a man's life's is no more than to say 'One.
But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself, For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his.
I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.
Peace, who comes here?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Dost know this water-fly?
No, my good lord.
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.
He hath much land, and fertile.
Let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the pos- session of dirt.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.
Put your bonnet to his right use.
tis for the head.
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere—I can- not tell how.
But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing.
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gen- tleman would see.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gen- tleman in our more rawer breath?
Sir?
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will to't, sir, really.
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
Of him, sir.
Well, sir?
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.
That's two of his weapons.
But, well.
What call you the carriages?
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more German to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
But on!
Why is this 'impawned,' as you call it?
How if I answer no?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.
If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me.
Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it.
Thus has he—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall.
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or when- soever, provided I be so able as now.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
She well instructs me.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I do not think so.
Since he went into France I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart.
But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord— It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
The readiness is all.
Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give me your pardon, sir.
This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd With sore distraction.
What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
Who does it, then?
His madness.
Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o'er the house And hurt my brother.
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge.
But in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor'd.
But till that time I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it.
I embrace it freely, And will this brother's wager frankly play.— Give us the foils.
Come on.
Come, one for me.
I'll be your foil, Laertes.
In mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.
You mock me, sir.
No, by this hand.
Give them the foils, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
I do not fear it, I have seen you both; But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
This likes me well.
These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn.
Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judgment!
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Well, again!
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health.
Give him the cup.
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come.
A touch, a touch; I do confess.
Our son shall win.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Good madam!
Gertrude, do not drink.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam—by-and-by.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.
And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Come for the third, Laertes!
Say you so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
Have at you now!
Part them!
They are incensed.
Look to the Queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides.
How is it, my lord?
How is't, Laertes?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
How does the Queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.
No, no!
I am poison'd.
O villainy!
Ho!
let the door be lock'd.
Treachery!
Seek it out.
It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good.
The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me.
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Thy mother's poison'd.
I can no more.
The King, the King's to blame.
The point envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
Treason!
treason!
O, yet defend me, friends!
I am but hurt.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion!
Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me!
Heaven make thee free of it!
I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio.
Wretched Queen, adieu!
Never believe it.
I am more an antique Romanthan a Dane.
Here's yet some liquor left.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.
I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
Now cracks a noble heart.
Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
Where is this sight?
What is it you will see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
This quarry cries on havoc.
O proud Death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?
Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about.
So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts; Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters; Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause; And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads.
All this can I Truly deliver.
Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royal; and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies.
